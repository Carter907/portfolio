                <p>Welcome to my about-me. I&#39;m Carter and I loving solving
                    problems. </p>
                <strong>How I came to love programming</strong><br/>
                    When was 17 I wasn&#39;t really sure what kind of career I wanted to pursue.
                    Originally I was considering on becoming an
                    <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/air-traffic-controllers.htm"> Air
                        Traffic Controller</a>
                    ; however, I didn&#39;t have that spark for it, that passion.
                    <p>
                    I had taken a coding class in high school, and I would consider myself a pretty
                    creative person,
                    so I decided to try out some JavaScript. Through my high-school
                        student service software, I found a course(<a href="https://codehs.com/course/1/explore"> Introduction to Computer Science
                        in JavaScript (Golden) (2022) </a>) and I immediately fell in love with it. Karel the dog become my new mission every evening, after school.
                    </p>The continuous feedback loop really drew me in.
                    Using my own creativity to solve problems felt so rewarding and personal.
                    For the first time, it felt like I had control over what software I wanted to consume.
                    While this was a very beginner course, it allowed to grasp something new and intriguing.

                <p><strong>Java (not JavaScript)</strong><br/>
                    I planned on taking AP Computer Science A the following semester, so I thought it would be a good idea to learn Java.
                    Being a real Minecraft fan during the 2010s, I felt like I had a personal obligation to at least give it a shot.
                    At fist I was a bit confused: I had never been introduced to Object-Orientated Programming before and I couldn&#39;t just
                    call functions off the cuff like before.
                    However, as soon as I got the idea of objects, the static keyword, and inheritance, the rest fell into place quiet easily. The restrictive
                    nature of static-typing and classes actually allowed me to better understand the code; it gave me a structure that I didn&#39;t know
                    I was missing.
